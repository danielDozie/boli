# B.oli 🚀
**Nigeria’s First Social Sentiment Exchange**

B.oli (Better Online Intelligence) is a high-fidelity forecasting platform leveraging social chatter and economic indicators to build Nigeria’s most accurate sentiment marketplace.

## 🎯 Objective

## ⚙️ Core Mechanisms

### 💎 Dual-Token System
- **Mana (Ṁ)**: Social currency minted upon sign-up. Used for low-stakes fun and learning the ropes.
- **eNaira (e₦)**: Premium currency validated via the **CBN API**. Used for high-stakes markets with real-world value.

### 📈 Liquidity & Automated Market Maker (AMM)
B.oli uses the **Constant Product Formula** ($x * y = k$) to ensure perpetual liquidity.
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Buying "Yes" increases its price and decreases "No" price instantly.
- **Always Open**: Trade 24/7 even without a direct counter-party.

## 🗺 Growth Strategy
1. **Phase 1 (The Hook)**: Focused on high-chatter entertainment (Music & BBNaija).
2. **Phase 2 (The Trust)**: Introduction of Economic Markets (Exchange rates, Fuel prices) to build institutional authority.
